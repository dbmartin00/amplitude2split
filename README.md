# Amplitude2Split

![alt text](http://www.cortazar-split.com/Amplitude2SplitEventsIntegration.png)

To run, build the project and find the executable JAR in the target/ subdirectory.  Create an amplitude2split.config (using instructions below) and be sure to put in correct API key and secret from Amplitude and Split Admin API key.  

### Maven build

mvn clean compile assembly:single

### Tool Execution

Run from command line (expects Java 11+):

java -jar amplitude2split-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar amplitude2split.config

### Tool Funciton

When run, builds a start and end time that describes the past durationInHours (as set in config), then invokes Amplitude's Export API (https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/export-api) to retrieve all events during that time period.  Amplitude responds with a compressed ZIP archive.  Amplitude2Split decompresses the archive in memory, yielding a set of GZIPd JSON files.  Amplitude2Split decompresses to JSON in memory, one file at a time, parsing the source JSON events and creating new Split JSON events.  Once a file finishes parsing, Amplitude2Split POSTs the Split Events in batches to Split's events API.  The contents of the events and the batch size is configurable.

It takes about a minute to send 40k events with the default batch size of 5000.

### Configuration Fields

* "amplitudeApiKey" "amplitudeApiSecret" - Amplitude API key and secret from Amplitude UI
* "splitApiKey" - Split Admin API key from Split UI
* "durationInHours" - query for events captured this many hours ago 
* "splitTrafficType" - Split traffic type, usually the default "user".
* "splitEnvironment" - Split environment, often the default "Prod-Default".
* "eventTypePrefix" - Split events will prefixed with "amp." by default to make them recognizable.  Empty string is accepted.
* "userIdField" - the Amplitude key to use for Split's event key, "user_id" by default.
* "valueField" - the Amplitude key to use for Split's value, empty means no value reported.  Should be a number.  Only root elements are found.
* "batchSize" - the number of Split events to post to Split in each batch
* "propertyFields" - the array of Amplitude event keys to include in Split.  You can add or remove any key.  Only root elements are found.

### Sample amplitude2split.config:
```
{
  "amplitudeApiKey" : "094c***********dc951",
  "amplitudeApiSecret" : "0fd15***********77844b3",
  "splitApiKey" : "1s46c********8b321",
  "durationInHours" : 1,
  "splitTrafficType" : "user",
  "splitEnvironment" : "Prod-Default",
  "eventTypePrefix" : "amp.",
  "userIdField" : "user_id",
  "valueField" : "",
  "batchSize" : 5000,
  "propertyFields" : [
  	 "country", 
  	 "language", 
  	 "device_type", 
  	 "device_carrier", 
  	 "uuid",
	 "region", 
	 "device_model", 
	 "city", 
	 "device_family", 
	 "platform", 
	 "os_version",
	 "ip_address", 
	 "os_name", 
	 "dma"
  ]
  
}
```
